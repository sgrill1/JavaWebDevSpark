## Feature Branches

### HandleBars

Building a demo webpage using the spark-template-engine https://github.com/perwendel/spark-template-engines/tree/master/spark-template-handlebars

Use the HandleBars Template to build a simple website with:

* An Index Page
* A submit form and button
* A dynamic sign-in page
* Cookies to store the username in memory
* Data Access Objects (_Note: The simple DAO class should not be used in production in place of a database , it is there simply as a prototype_)
